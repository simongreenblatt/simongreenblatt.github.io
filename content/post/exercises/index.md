## Bypassing Access Controls

![ ](cameras.jpg)

In this exercise I break a fictitious autograding system to steal other student's assignments and trick it into giving me a good grade. I use my knowledge of file permissions, **setuid Linux programs**, and process isolation to create exploits that take advantage of vulnerabilities I found in the source code. As an exercise in **privilege escalation**, I demonstrate how safelists, input sanitization, and the principle of least privilege can be used to prevent unauthorized usage of privileged instructions.
