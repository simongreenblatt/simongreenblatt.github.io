Hi! I'm glad you've taken the time to visit my website and that you're interested in learning more about me.

I'm currently working as a Cybersecurity Intern at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/) for the U.S. Department of Energy assessing device security. I recently completed my Master's in **Cybersecurity** at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), one of the eight **Ivy League** private research universities. I was enrolled in the Computer Science track which focuses on the technical and computational aspects of Cybersecurity, while gaining a complementary perspective on organizational management and law. I previously completed my undergraduate studies at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/) where I graduated **summa cum laude** in Mathematics with a Minor in Computer Programming.

I have experience with secure software development, computer architecture, and networking, as well as mathematical and applied cryptography. My main areas of interest are **Computer Security** and **Cryptography**. My goal is to specialize in penetration testing and the management of IT systems to solve complex, real-world security problems.
