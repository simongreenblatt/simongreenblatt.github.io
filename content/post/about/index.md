Hi! I'm glad you've taken the time to visit my website and that you're interested in learning more about me.

I'm currently working as a Commercial Security Analyst at [Varonis](https://www.varonis.com/), delivering threat detection and incident response initiatives to customers. I recently completed my Master's in **Cybersecurity** at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), one of the eight **Ivy League** private research universities in the northeastern United States. I was enrolled in the Computer Science track which focuses on the technical and computational aspects of cybersecurity while gaining a complementary perspective on organizational management and law. I previously completed my undergraduate studies at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/) where I graduated **summa cum laude** in Mathematics with a Minor in Computer Programming and an emphasis on cryptography. I also hold the Security+ certification which validates baseline skills for IT security roles.

I have experience with secure software development, computer architecture, and hacking, as well as mathematical and applied cryptography. My main areas of interest are software security, cryptography, and **penetration testing**. My goal is to specialize in penetration testing to help mitigate risk in computer systems by identifying vulnerabilities and evaluating their security.  
Feel free to take a look at some of the projects, research papers, and hacking exercises I've worked on.
