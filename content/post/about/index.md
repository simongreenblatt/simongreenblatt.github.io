Hi! I'm glad you've taken the time to visit my website and that you're interested in learning more about me.

I'm currently a Master's student at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) (one of the eight **Ivy League** private research universities) studying **Cybersecurity**. I'm enrolled in the Computer Science track which focuses on the technical and computing aspects of Cybersecurity, while gaining a complementary perspective on human factors and law. I previously completed my undergraduate studies at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/) where I graduated **summa cum laude** in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Programming.

I like to climb volcanos!

I have experience with software development, computer architecture, and distributed systems, as well as mathematical and applied cryptography. My main areas of interest are **Cryptography** and **Computer Security** in the context of protecting networks, devices, and data. My goal is to specialize in threat modeling and the management of IT systems in order to solve complex, real-world security problems.

#### Education

- Sc.M. in Cybersecurity (Computer Science track) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), *expected 05/2024*
