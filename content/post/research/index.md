## Lattice-Based Cryptography

My undergraduate Mathematics Capstone project puts forth the theory of **lattices** as a viable source of **quantum-resistant** cryptographic problems. In it, I discuss the GGH and NTRU lattice-based cryptosystems as well as their mathematical background. I also introduce the LLL lattice reduction algorithm as a tool for **cryptanalysis** on lattices. As part of this project, I coded a version of the LLL algorithm (in the C language) and presented my results to the Mathematics Honors Program at my university.

## Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

This collaborative paper examines the mathematics behind the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange. We provide an algebraic background to the **discrete logarithm problem** and a concrete example of the algorithm in action. Additionaly, we discuss computational difficulties in implementing it and explain how the **Binary Exponential Algorithm** solves these problems.

## Cybersecurity of Critical Infrastructure

The U.S. government has adopted a voluntary, nonregulatory, incentive-based framework for protecting the various critical infrastructure sectors. This has led to a jumble of incentives and a general lack of legislation. I this paper, I lay out an agenda for increasing adoption of the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** and expanding the role of the CISA information sharing program while taking into account the **economic, social, and moral incentives** at play. I also advocate for a reassessment of the definition for "commercial information technology product".

## Usability of Authentication

"You're only as strong as your weakest link". Too often companies rely on security training and password complexity requirements to ensure proper use of **authentication mechanisms**. However, this overexposure to training bombardment can lead to security fatigue. This paper argues that usability is a better approach to achieving security goals while reducing friction in the user experience. I address usability in the context of **password management**, multi-factor authentication, security questions, and mobile authentication.
