## Data Structures and Algorithms

![Structures](structures.jpg)

This **Java** library of over 30 data structures and algorithms demonstrates the importance of **algorithmic complexity** in relation to the choice of data structures. In it, I've coded linked list and array-based variations of stacks, queues, trees, lists, graphs, hash tables, and other structures. I've also included implementations of related algorithms such as Quicksort, Breadth-first search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, tree traversal algorithms, and many others. This project was built using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming and does not rely on existing Java libraries.

## Management System Application

Based on the Model-View-Controller design pattern, I developed a **management application** for handling the customers, inventory, and orders of a fictional business. This project gave me experience in the **software development lifecycle**, debugging techniques, continuous integration practices, and unit/system testing. From UML class diagram proposals to user stories, this project took a comprehensive look at software development processes and practices.
